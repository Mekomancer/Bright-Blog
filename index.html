    <h3>Normal server farms</h3>
    <p>
        <i>Server farm</i> is a term for a large collection of servers&mdash;a type of computer. Typically, they are
        housed in big warehouses that have been retrofitted to support the power supply and heat dispersion needs of a server farm. These warehouses release a bunch of greenhouse gases, both during construction and operation.

    <h3>What Microsoft did</h3>
    <p>
        The ocean is cold, cold stuff cools down hot stuff, server farms are hot and need cooling, so we should put
        servers in the ocean. Now at first this seems to be a very dumb idea&mdash;given the imcompatibility of water
        and technology&mdash;but Microsoft didn't just put servers straight into the water.

    <p>
        Microsoft put the servers in a giant steel vessel, lowered it to the sea floor, slightly away from the coast, and just let it be. The results were amazing, the servers broke down less and used less energy.
    </p>
    <h3>The future</h3>
    <p>
        The underwater server farms were not just better, they were also cheaper. Hopefully others can effectivily implement this stategy, which will reduce emissions, and reduce the need for constructing warehouses.
